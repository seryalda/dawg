## Overview

DAWG (AC Relay Driver Board). This board is purpose-built to address a common need in electronics projects: providing a reliable AC relay driver. Its primary goal is to enable low-voltage output controllers like Arduino and ESP microcontrollers to efficiently control multiple AC CONTACTORS or Industrial DC Relay Switches (of DC voltage more than 12VDC).

## Features

- **Relay Control:** This feature simplifies the process of controlling mechanical and solid-state relays, enabling you to manage higher voltage loads with ease.

- **Versatility:** The board is designed to drive HV relay switches, encompassing both mechanical and solid-state options, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications.

- **Ease of Integration:** The board ensures easy integration through user-friendly terminal screw blocks, connectors, and pin headers configurations.

- **DIN Rail Support:** DIN RAIL compatibility enables seamless mounting in standard 35mm DIN RAIL enclosures. This feature ensures that your projects have a professional and sturdy appearance and can be effortlessly integrated into existing distribution panels.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Access comprehensive documentation to swiftly get started and leverage the full potential of your relay driver.

Please note that GitHub's markdown doesn't directly support specifying image dimensions using HTML-like attributes, so these dimensions might not directly work. GitHub supports HTML tags to a certain extent, but it might not render as expected. Adjustments might be needed based on the markdown rendering of the platform you're using.
