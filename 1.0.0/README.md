## Overview

The DAWG AC Relay Driver Board is a purpose-built, specialized solution for electronics projects. Measuring 76mm x 86mm, this RAIL DIN board with two screw holes (25mm center to center apart) offers a reliable means to control AC CONTACTORS or Industrial DC Relay Switches with DC voltage exceeding 12VDC. Unlike standard relays, this 4-channel relay driver serves as an intermediary, allowing low-voltage output controllers like Arduino and ESP microcontrollers to effectively activate external DC relay switches using user-selected AC voltages.

Powered by an external 5VDC source, the board simplifies the control of multiple relay switches for diverse applications, making it an ideal choice for various electronic projects.

### Features
- 4-channel relay driver board for AC CONTACTORS and Industrial DC Relay Switches.
- Designed to work with low-voltage output controllers like Arduino and ESP microcontrollers.
- Enables control of external DC relay switches using user-selected AC voltages.
- Dimensions: 76mm x 86mm RAIL DIN board with two screw holes.
- External 5VDC power source for operation.
- Ideal for applications requiring reliable and efficient relay driving.
