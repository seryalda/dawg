DAWG (AC Relay Driver Board). This board is purpose-built to address a common need in electronics projects: providing a reliable AC relay driver. Its primary goal is to enable low-voltage output controllers like Arduino and ESP microcontrollers to efficiently control multiple AC CONTACTORS or Industrial DC Relay Switches (of DC voltage more than 12VDC).
